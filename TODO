# Next
- [ ] Add login functionality
- [ ] Add profile views/page
- [ ] Add choir leader views/flows
- [ ] Add AJAX for choir leader views/flows in place
- [ ] Add support for multiple choirs
- [ ] Decide if songs and songfiles should belong to a choir or belong to a user (Probably the user)
- [ ] make sure there's separation of files in the media folder

- [ ] Document project/app responsibilities/structure


# Waiting
- [ ] Create dashboard frontend


# Future
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Check if you can delete bootstrap stylesheet and scripts
- [ ] Make navbar start out as open on desktop (and as closed on mobile)
- [ ] Make navbar remember whether the navbar was closed or open when reloading/changing pages (this isn't gonna be that simple. For example, you want the default behavior when having clicked a link on mobile to be for the bar to be hidden on the next page. But you _don't_ want this on desktop. Probably gonna have to use javascript and django's context variables?)
- [ ] Don't allow user to change attendanceDeclaration once event has passed
- [ ] Fix single song view
    - [ ] Extend background to whole screen
    - [ ] Make all the layouts uniform regardless of number of voices
    - [ ] Fix layout in tablet mode (it's not centered and looks funky)
    - [ ] Decrease size of margin between stuff



# In production
- [ ] Figure out a way of serving media files
- [ ] Make sure django is properly handling reuploading files (pdf, webp, mp3) so that it deletes the previous version instead of storing it. Don't want our data to get out of hand (Maybe find a way to keep one backup?)

# Before deploying
- [ ] Make sure HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Change allauth setting ACCOUNT_DEFAULT_HTTP_PROTOCOL to 'https'
- [ ] Change allauth setting ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION to 'mandatory'

- [x] Add processing of pdf files during model save
- [x] Rename display group songs???
- [x] Add events (models, views, in nav)
