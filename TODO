# Future

- [ ] Check if you can delete bootstrap stylesheet and scripts
- [ ] Change logout icon in sidenav and delete boxicon styles
- [ ] Make navbar start out as open on desktop (and as closed on mobile)
- [ ] Make navbar remember whether the navbar was closed or open when reloading/changing pages (this isn't gonna be that simple. For example, you want the default behavior when having clicked a link on mobile to be for the bar to be hidden on the next page. But you _don't_ want this on desktop. Probably gonna have to use javascript and django's context variables?)
- [ ] Don't allow user to change attendanceDeclaration once event has passed
- [ ] Fix single song view
    - [ ] Extend background to whole screen
    - [ ] Make all the layouts uniform regardless of number of voices

    - [ ] Decrease size of margin between stuff
    - [ ] Add email notifications (to me) whenever someone signs up

# After job fair
- [ ] Rename the project to choirhub
- [ ] Redeploy it properly (right now it is hot garbage)
- [ ] Double check that django-sass is needed in production requirements

# In production
- [ ] Figure out a way of serving media files
- [ ] Make sure django is properly handling reuploading files (pdf, webp, mp3) so that it deletes the previous version instead of storing it. Don't want our data to get out of hand (Maybe find a way to keep one backup?)

# Before deploying
- [ ] Make sure HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Change allauth setting ACCOUNT_DEFAULT_HTTP_PROTOCOL to 'https'
- [ ] Change allauth setting ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION to 'mandatory'
