# Next
- [ ] Add events (models, views, in nav)
- [ ] Add login functionality
- [ ] Add profile views/page
- [ ] Add choir leader views/flows
- [ ] Add AJAX for choir leader views/flows in place

- [ ] Document project/app responsibilities/structure


# Waiting
- [ ] Create dashboard frontend


# Future
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Make navbar start out as open on desktop (and as closed on mobile)
- [ ] Make navbar remember whether the navbar was closed or open when reloading/changing pages (this isn't gonna be that simple. For example, you want the default behavior when having clicked a link on mobile to be for the bar to be hidden on the next page. But you _don't_ want this on desktop. Probably gonna have to use javascript and django's context variables?)

# In production
- [ ] Figure out a way of serving media files

# Before deploying
- [ ] Make sure HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Change allauth setting ACCOUNT_DEFAULT_HTTP_PROTOCOL to 'https'
- [ ] Change allauth setting ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION to 'mandatory'


# Done
- [x] Go through argon templates and see if I have all the templates
- [x] Replace navbar with something useful
- [x] Create song display snippet
