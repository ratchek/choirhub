# Next
- [ ] Document project/app responsibilities/structure
- [ ] Create song display snippet


- [ ] Replace navbar with something useful

# Future
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Go through argon templates and see if I have all the templates
- [ ] Make navbar start out as open on desktop (and as closed on mobile)
- [ ] Make navbar remember whether the navbar was closed or open when reloading/changing pages (this isn't gonna be that simple. For example, you want the default behavior when having clicked a link on mobile to be for the bar to be hidden on the next page. But you _don't_ want this on desktop. Probably gonna have to use javascript and django's context variables?)
